## Jira Workflow

Copy this file to your project's `.claude/jira-workflow.md` and fill in your details. Then reference it from `CLAUDE.md` at your project root so every Claude Code session auto-loads it:

```
@.claude/jira-workflow.md
```

### Jira

- **Site**: `{SITE}`
- **Project key(s)**: `{KEY}` (issue keys look like `{KEY}-123`)
- **Board name**: `{BOARD}`

### Issue Lifecycle

To Do → In Progress → In Review → Done

(Replace with your project's actual workflow statuses.)

- **Status when starting work**: `In Progress`
- **Status when done**: `Done`

The worker reads these two values and transitions the issue accordingly: to "starting work" before implementing, and to "done" after committing (before running `task-done`).

### Issue Fields

Customize for your project:
- **Summary**, **Status**, **Priority**, **Issue type** (Story / Task / Bug)
- **Assignee**, **Labels**, **Sprint**, **Epic link**
- **Linked PR** (set after `task-done` produces a PR URL)

### Where Specs Live

The Planner writes its spec into the issue **description** (overwriting) **OR** as a **comment**. Pick one and document it here:

- [x] Description (overwrite)
- [ ] Comment

### Commit Convention

Reference the Jira key as a prefix: `{KEY}-123: <short description>`

### Shell Commands

- `task-work <JIRA-KEY-or-url-or-slug>` — create worktree + zellij tab + worker session
- `task-done` — from within a worktree: show diff, print PR command, cleanup
- `task-done --remove-worktree` — cleanup only (use after worker has already created the PR)

### Atlassian MCP

This workflow assumes the Atlassian Remote MCP server is configured. Verify with:

```
claude mcp list
```

You should see an `atlassian` entry. If not, see Atlassian's documentation for the Remote MCP server.
