## Jira Workflow

Copy this file to your project's `.claude/jira-workflow.md` and fill in your details. Then reference it from `CLAUDE.md` at your project root so every Claude Code session auto-loads it:

```
@.claude/jira-workflow.md
```

### Jira

- **Site**: `{SITE}`
- **Project key(s)**: `{KEY}` (issue keys look like `{KEY}-123`)
- **Board name**: `{BOARD}`

### Issue Lifecycle

To Do → In Progress → In Review → Done

(Replace with your project's actual workflow statuses.)

- **Status when starting work**: `In Progress`
- **Status when in review**: `In Review` (leave blank if your workflow has no In Review transition — the worker will keep the issue at `In Progress` through review)
- **Status when done**: `Done`

The worker reads these three values and transitions the issue as it moves through the lifecycle: to "starting work" before implementing, to "in review" after opening the PR, and to "done" only after the PM signals `approved-and-merged` via radio.

### Issue Fields

Customize for your project:
- **Summary**, **Status**, **Priority**, **Issue type** (Story / Task / Bug)
- **Assignee**, **Labels**, **Sprint**, **Epic link**
- **Linked PR** (set after `task-done` produces a PR URL)

### Where Specs Live

The Planner writes its spec into the issue **description** (overwriting) **OR** as a **comment**. Pick one and document it here:

- [x] Description (overwrite)
- [ ] Comment

### Commit Convention

Reference the Jira key as a prefix: `{KEY}-123: <short description>`

### Shell Commands

`task-work <JIRA-KEY-or-url-or-slug> [options]` — create worktree + zellij tab + worker session

- `-b, --base BRANCH` — branch the PR will target (default: current branch at call time)
- `-f, --from REF` — git ref to fork the new worktree's branch from (default: `HEAD`)
- `-p, --plan` — launch the worker in Claude plan mode (runs `/planner`); mutually exclusive with `--auto`
- `--auto` — launch the worker in Claude auto permission mode (runs `/worker`); mutually exclusive with `--plan`

If local `<base>` is strictly behind `origin/<base>`, `task-work` auto-refreshes and forks the new worktree from `origin/<base>` instead of the stale local tip. Pass `--from` to override.

Examples:
```bash
task-work {KEY}-42
task-work https://{SITE}.atlassian.net/browse/{KEY}-42
task-work refactor-auth --plan
task-work {KEY}-99 --from task/{KEY}-46 --base main --auto   # stack on an in-flight branch
```

`task-done [options]` — from within a worktree: show diff, print/detect PR, cleanup

- `--force` — skip all confirmation prompts
- `--remove-worktree` — cleanup only (use after worker has already created the PR)

### Atlassian MCP

This workflow assumes the Atlassian Remote MCP server is configured. Verify with:

```
claude mcp list
```

You should see an `atlassian` entry. If not, see Atlassian's documentation for the Remote MCP server.
### PM ↔ worker messaging (radio)

Radio is the **canonical** coordination channel between the PM and workers — every
role transition runs through it. The PM / planner / worker prompts shell out to
`radio send` at every documented handoff point:

| From    | When                            | Command                                                                |
|---------|---------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Planner | spec written into the issue     | `radio send --to pm --intent spec-ready --issue <KEY-N>`               |
| Worker  | PR opened                       | `radio send --to pm --intent review-requested --pr <N>`                |
| Worker  | new commits pushed after review | `radio send --to pm --intent re-review-requested --pr <N>`             |
| PM      | review requested changes        | `radio send --to <worker-role> --intent changes-requested --pr <N>`    |
| PM      | PR merged                       | `radio send --to <worker-role> --intent approved-and-merged --pr <N>`  |

When a worker's turn ends, the `Stop` hook runs `radio stop-hook`
automatically: with an empty inbox it marks the role idle; if messages queued
up while the worker was busy, it blocks the stop (staying busy) so the agent
drains them immediately — you don't need to invoke it manually.

Full command form:

```bash
radio send --to <role> --intent <kind> [--pr N] [--issue N] [--body TEXT]
```

The body comes from `--body` or stdin. PR review *content* still lives in
`gh pr comment`s — `radio` only carries the routing ping. Worker role names
follow `worker-<reponame>-<slug>`; discover the live one via
`ls ~/.task-force/radio/sessions/`.

To launch the PM agent in this repo, run `task-pm` from any tab — it renames
the current zellij tab to `pm`, registers via the `SessionStart` hook, and
starts the PM agent in-place.

If a worker tab dies unexpectedly (or Claude resumes a session without
re-firing `SessionStart`), the session file's `LAST_HEARTBEAT` will go stale.
Run `radio orphans` to list any session whose heartbeat is older than 1 hour —
those entries are safe to delete (`rm ~/.task-force/radio/sessions/<role>.info`)
or leave for the next legitimate `radio register` to overwrite.
