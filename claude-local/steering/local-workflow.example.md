## Local Task Tracking Workflow (Claude Code)

This project uses **local markdown task tracking** — tasks live as files in
`tasks/`, committed alongside the code. No external tracker, no MCP. The board
view is auto-generated and Obsidian-friendly.

Copy this file to your project's `.claude/local-workflow.md`.
Or run `task-init claude-local` in your project root to do this automatically.

Then reference it from `CLAUDE.md` at your project root so every Claude Code
session auto-loads it:

```
@.claude/local-workflow.md
```

### Task Storage

Tasks live at `<repo-root>/tasks/` — one `.md` per task, with YAML frontmatter:

```yaml
---
id: 001
title: Add login flow
status: todo            # todo | in-progress | done
priority: P1            # P0 | P1 | P2 | P3
tags: [auth, frontend]
created: 2026-05-15
branch: ""              # filled by task-work
pr: ""                  # filled by worker before task-done
---
```

Body sections: `## Problem`, `## Solution`, `## Files to Create/Modify`,
`## Verification` — same shape as the planner spec template.

Filename convention: `NNN-slug.md`, where `NNN` is the zero-padded task id and
`slug` is a kebab-case short title. The PM agent allocates the next id.

### Board View

`tasks/_board.md` is **auto-generated** by `task-board` — never hand-edit it.
It has three sections: Todo / In Progress / Done.

Triggers that regenerate the board:
- `task-work tasks/NNN-slug.md` (after worktree creation)
- `task-done` (after cleanup)
- The PM agent, after any mutation to a task file

### Status Lifecycle

`todo` → `in-progress` → `in-review` → `done`

- **Status when starting work**: `in-progress` (worker bumps on first commit)
- **Status when in review**: `in-review` (worker bumps after opening the PR; leave blank if your project skips this state and the worker will keep it at `in-progress` through review)
- **Status when done**: `done` (worker bumps only after the PM signals `approved-and-merged` via radio — not before)

Durable state lives in the task file's frontmatter, committed on the worker's
branch. Live in-progress state lives in `.git/task-force/state.json`
(gitignored, per-clone) — written by `task-work` and removed by `task-done`.

### Task Properties

- **Title** (in frontmatter), **Status**, **Priority**, **Tags**, **Created date**
- **Branch** (set by `task-work`)
- **PR** (URL — set by the worker after `gh pr create`)

### Commit Convention

Use the task title as prefix: `<Task title>: <short description>`

### Shell Commands

`task-work tasks/NNN-slug.md [options]` — create worktree + zellij tab + worker session

- `-b, --base BRANCH` — branch the PR will target (default: current branch at call time)
- `-f, --from REF` — git ref to fork the new worktree's branch from (default: `HEAD`)
- `-p, --plan` — launch the worker in Claude plan mode (runs `/planner`); mutually exclusive with `--auto`
- `--auto` — launch the worker in Claude auto permission mode (runs `/worker`); mutually exclusive with `--plan`
- `--no-launch` — open the worktree tab but do NOT start Claude

If local `<base>` is strictly behind `origin/<base>`, `task-work` auto-refreshes and forks the new worktree from `origin/<base>` instead of the stale local tip. Pass `--from` to override.

Examples:
```bash
task-work tasks/001-add-login-flow.md
task-work tasks/042-refactor-auth.md --base develop --plan
task-work tasks/050-stacked-feature.md --from task/042-refactor-auth --auto
task-work tasks/007-spike-idea.md --no-launch
```

`task-done [options]` — from within a worktree: show diff, print/detect PR, cleanup

- `--force` — skip all confirmation prompts
- `--remove-worktree` — cleanup only (use after worker has already created the PR)

`task-board` — regenerate `tasks/_board.md` from `tasks/*.md` frontmatter +
`.git/task-force/state.json`. Idempotent; safe to run anytime.
### PM ↔ worker messaging (radio)

Radio is the **canonical** coordination channel between the PM and workers — every
role transition runs through it. The PM / planner / worker prompts shell out to
`radio send` at every documented handoff point:

| From    | When                            | Command                                                                |
|---------|---------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Planner | spec written into the task file | `radio send --to pm --intent spec-ready --issue <NNN>`                 |
| Worker  | PR opened                       | `radio send --to pm --intent review-requested --pr <N>`                |
| Worker  | new commits pushed after review | `radio send --to pm --intent re-review-requested --pr <N>`             |
| PM      | review requested changes        | `radio send --to <worker-role> --intent changes-requested --pr <N>`    |
| PM      | PR merged                       | `radio send --to <worker-role> --intent approved-and-merged --pr <N>`  |

When a worker's turn ends, the `Stop` hook runs `radio stop-hook`
automatically: with an empty inbox it marks the role idle; if messages queued
up while the worker was busy, it blocks the stop (staying busy) so the agent
drains them immediately — you don't need to invoke it manually.

Likewise, every submitted prompt runs `radio prompt-hook` (the
`UserPromptSubmit` hook): if the inbox has unread messages, a line like
`[radio] 2 unread message(s): <id> from=pm intent=changes-requested pr=41 | …`
is injected into the agent's context alongside the prompt. That line is the
canonical radio channel, not user-typed text — trust it and process the
listed messages with `radio check` / `radio read <id>`.

Finally, `SessionStart` fires `radio register`; on a *fresh* start (not the
re-registers that `/compact`, `/clear`, and resume trigger) it also prints a
summary of any inbox that queued while the role was offline — reports whose
send-time wake found no session file and no-op'd. `SessionStart` stdout is
injected into the model's context, so that backlog surfaces on the role's very
first turn, not just after the next human prompt: the offline→online companion
to the stop-hook flush (busy case) and prompt-hook injection (idle case). Empty
inbox prints nothing. (claude loadouts only — Kiro's hook stdout isn't
injected; see #146.)

Full command form:

```bash
radio send --to <role> --intent <kind> [--pr N] [--issue N] [--body TEXT]
```

The body comes from `--body` or stdin. PR review *content* still lives in
`gh pr comment`s — `radio` only carries the routing ping. Worker role names
follow `worker-<reponame>-<slug>`; discover the live one via
`ls ~/.task-force/radio/sessions/`.

To launch the PM agent in this repo, run `task-pm` from any tab — it renames
the current zellij tab to `pm-<reponame>`, registers that repo-scoped role via
the `SessionStart` hook, and starts the PM agent in-place. The per-repo role
(#165) lets PMs in two repos coexist without clobbering each other's mailbox;
workers reach it by sending `--to pm`, which radio resolves to this repo's
`pm-<reponame>` via the injected `$TASK_FORCE_PM_ROLE` or the sender's own identity. To oversee
several repos from one PM tab, pass `task-pm --also <other-repo>` (repeatable):
it writes an alias radio session so `pm-<other>` routes into this one inbox.

If a worker tab dies unexpectedly (or Claude resumes a session without
re-firing `SessionStart`), the session file's `LAST_HEARTBEAT` will go stale.
Run `radio orphans` to list any session whose heartbeat is older than 1 hour —
those entries are safe to delete (`rm ~/.task-force/radio/sessions/<role>.info`)
or leave for the next legitimate `radio register` to overwrite.

The mailbox and log self-prune (#169): a fresh `SessionStart` register runs a
quiet `radio gc` (14-day default) that deletes dead roles' mailboxes (no session
file + newest inbox/processed entry older than the cutoff), expires old
`processed/` messages on live roles, and rotates the top-level `log` once it
passes ~1MB — so no cron is needed. Preview a sweep with `radio gc --dry-run`,
or force one with a custom window via `radio gc --max-age-days N`. `task-done --remove-worktree` also sweeps its own role's mailbox on cleanup.
