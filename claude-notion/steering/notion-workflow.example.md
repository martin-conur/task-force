## Notion Workflow (Claude Code)

Copy this file to your project's `.claude/notion-workflow.md` and fill in your Notion database IDs.
Or run `task-init claude-notion` in your project root to do this automatically.

Then reference it from `CLAUDE.md` at your project root so every Claude Code session auto-loads it:

```
@.claude/notion-workflow.md
```

### Notion MCP (Claude Code)

This workflow requires the Notion MCP server configured in Claude Code. Verify with:

```bash
claude mcp list
```

You should see a `notion` entry. If not, add it:

```bash
claude mcp add --transport http notion https://mcp.notion.com/mcp
```

### Notion Database IDs

<!-- Replace each placeholder with the real ID.
     Run `task-init claude-notion --help-ids` for step-by-step discovery instructions.

     What each ID looks like:
       collection://...  — opaque string from the Notion MCP (data-source URL)
       board page ID     — UUID like 8a1b2c3d-e4f5-6789-abcd-ef0123456789

     How to find them (requires Notion MCP active in Claude Code):
       1. Run: claude
       2. Ask: "Help me find my Notion database IDs"
       3. Claude will list your boards and extract the IDs from the MCP response
-->

- **Tasks**: `collection://<YOUR_TASKS_DATA_SOURCE_ID>`
- **Projects**: `collection://<YOUR_PROJECTS_DATA_SOURCE_ID>`
- **Board page**: `<YOUR_BOARD_PAGE_ID>`

### Task Lifecycle

Not Started → In Progress → In Review → Done (or Archived)

- **Status when starting work**: `In Progress`
- **Status when in review**: `In Review` (leave blank or omit if your Notion database has no In Review option — the worker will keep the task at `In Progress` through review)
- **Status when done**: `Done`

The worker reads these three values and updates the task's Status property as it moves through the lifecycle: to "starting work" before implementing, to "in review" after opening the PR, and to "done" only after the PM signals `approved-and-merged` via radio.

### Task Properties

Customize these to match your Notion database schema:
- **Task name** (title), **Status**, **Priority**
- **Project** (relation), **Tags** (multi-select)
- **Git commit** (URL — set to PR or commit link after done)

### Commit Convention

Use the task name as prefix: `<Task name>: <description>`

### Shell Commands

`task-work <slug> [notion-url] [options]` — create worktree + zellij tab + worker session

- `-b, --base BRANCH` — branch the PR will target (default: current branch at call time)
- `-f, --from REF` — git ref to fork the new worktree's branch from (default: `HEAD`)
- `-p, --plan` — launch the worker in Claude plan mode (runs `/planner`); mutually exclusive with `--auto`
- `--auto` — launch the worker in Claude auto permission mode (runs `/worker`); mutually exclusive with `--plan`
- `--no-launch` — open the worktree tab but do NOT start Claude (lets you type the command yourself)

If local `<base>` is strictly behind `origin/<base>`, `task-work` auto-refreshes and forks the new worktree from `origin/<base>` instead of the stale local tip. Pass `--from` to override.

Examples:
```bash
task-work add-store-filtering https://www.notion.so/My-Task-abc123def456
task-work refactor-auth --plan
task-work feature-x --from task/in-flight --base main --auto   # stack on an in-flight branch
task-work spike-idea --no-launch
```

`task-done [options]` — from within a worktree: show diff, print/detect PR, cleanup

- `--force` — skip all confirmation prompts
- `--remove-worktree` — cleanup only (use after worker has already created the PR)
### PM ↔ worker messaging (radio)

Radio is the **canonical** coordination channel between the PM and workers — every
role transition runs through it. The PM / planner / worker prompts shell out to
`radio send` at every documented handoff point:

| From    | When                            | Command                                                                |
|---------|---------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Planner | spec written into the task page | `radio send --to pm --intent spec-ready --issue <task-slug>`           |
| Worker  | PR opened                       | `radio send --to pm --intent review-requested --pr <N>`                |
| Worker  | new commits pushed after review | `radio send --to pm --intent re-review-requested --pr <N>`             |
| PM      | review requested changes        | `radio send --to <worker-role> --intent changes-requested --pr <N>`    |
| PM      | PR merged                       | `radio send --to <worker-role> --intent approved-and-merged --pr <N>`  |

When a worker's turn ends, the `Stop` hook runs `radio stop-hook`
automatically: with an empty inbox it marks the role idle; if messages queued
up while the worker was busy, it blocks the stop (staying busy) so the agent
drains them immediately — you don't need to invoke it manually.

Likewise, every submitted prompt runs `radio prompt-hook` (the
`UserPromptSubmit` hook): if the inbox has unread messages, a line like
`[radio] 2 unread message(s): <id> from=pm intent=changes-requested pr=41 | …`
is injected into the agent's context alongside the prompt. That line is the
canonical radio channel, not user-typed text — trust it and process the
listed messages with `radio check` / `radio read <id>`.

Full command form:

```bash
radio send --to <role> --intent <kind> [--pr N] [--issue N] [--body TEXT]
```

The body comes from `--body` or stdin. PR review *content* still lives in
`gh pr comment`s — `radio` only carries the routing ping. Worker role names
follow `worker-<reponame>-<slug>`; discover the live one via
`ls ~/.task-force/radio/sessions/`.

### Reviewer role (single-shot, self-cleaning)

On a worker's `review-requested`, the PM may dispatch a reviewer with
`task-reviewer <pr> [<notion-spec-url>]` (add `Bash(task-reviewer *)` to your
project's `.claude/settings.json` `permissions.allow` so the PM dispatches
hands-off without a permission prompt). The reviewer is **single-shot**: it reads
the spec + diff, runs the `code-review` skill, posts **one** PR comment carrying
its full analysis + verdict, radios the PM `review-complete-clean` /
`review-complete-with-findings`, then **auto-destructs** (`task-done
--remove-worktree` — removes its worktree and closes its tab). It does NOT idle
waiting to be closed. The analysis lives in the PR comment, not the tab; the PM
reads the verdict on its next `radio check` and forwards findings to the worker.

### Tight-PR norm — minimize deferrals

Default to landing each PR **complete**. The reviewer frames every finding as
fix-in-this-PR (never "defer to a follow-up" for in-scope work), and the PM forwards
**all** in-scope findings — blockers *and* nits — in a single `changes-requested`
round rather than trailing a backlog of deferred items. The only thing that gets
deferred is work genuinely out of the PR's scope (a separate subsystem, a large
refactor) — and the PM grooms that into a ticket during the session, not left as a
loose "later."

To launch the PM agent in this repo, run `task-pm` from any tab — it renames
the current zellij tab to `pm`, registers via the `SessionStart` hook, and
starts the PM agent in-place.

If a worker tab dies unexpectedly (or Claude resumes a session without
re-firing `SessionStart`), the session file's `LAST_HEARTBEAT` will go stale.
Run `radio orphans` to list any session whose heartbeat is older than 1 hour —
those entries are safe to delete (`rm ~/.task-force/radio/sessions/<role>.info`)
or leave for the next legitimate `radio register` to overwrite.
