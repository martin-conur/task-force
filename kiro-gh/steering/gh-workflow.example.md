## GitHub Projects Workflow (Kiro)

Copy this file to your project's `.kiro/steering/gh-workflow.md` and fill in your details.
Or run `task-init kiro-gh` in your project root to do this automatically.

### GitHub CLI (`gh`)

This workflow uses the [`gh` CLI](https://cli.github.com) for issue / project / PR I/O. Verify you're authenticated:

```bash
gh auth status
```

If not, run `gh auth login` (needs `repo` + `project` scopes). The bundled PM / planner / worker agents shell out to `gh` directly via `execute_bash`. Mutations stay confirmation-gated; with `--trust-all` on `task-work`, every `gh` call is auto-approved.

#### Optional: GitHub MCP for richer Projects v2 mutations

`gh project item-edit` covers the common single-select / number / text mutations. If you frequently mutate iteration fields or want a higher-level Projects v2 API, add the GitHub MCP to each agent's `mcpServers` block (the bundled agents ship without it; add it back if you want it):

```json
"mcpServers": {
  "github": { "command": "npx", "args": ["-y", "@github/github-mcp-server"] }
}
```

Only when the MCP add-on is enabled: set `GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN` in your environment before running Kiro, and add `@github` to each agent's `tools` (and `allowedTools` to skip the confirmation). Without the add-on, no PAT is needed — `gh auth` covers it.

### GitHub Repository

- **Owner**: `{OWNER}` (GitHub user or org name)
- **Repo**: `{REPO}` (repository name)
- **Project number**: `{PROJECT}` (from the project URL: github.com/users/{OWNER}/projects/N or github.com/orgs/{OWNER}/projects/N)

### Task Lifecycle

Todo → In Progress → In Review → Done

- **Status when starting work**: `In Progress`
- **Status when in review**: `In Review` (leave blank or omit if your project has no In Review column — the worker will keep the issue at `In Progress` through review)
- **Status when done**: `Done`

The worker reads these three values and updates the project item's Status field as it moves through the lifecycle: to "starting work" before implementing, to "in review" after opening the PR, and to "done" only after the PM signals `approved-and-merged` via radio.

### Task Properties

- **Title** (issue title), **Status** (project single-select field), **Priority** (project field)
- **Git commit** (URL — set to PR link after done)

### Commit Convention

Use the issue title as prefix: `<Issue title>: <short description>`

### Shell Commands

`task-work <slug> [gh-url] [options]` — create worktree + zellij tab + worker agent

- `-m, --model MODEL` — pick a specific kiro model
- `-a, --trust-all` — pass `--trust-all-tools` so the worker runs without per-tool confirmation
- `-b, --base BRANCH` — branch the PR will target (default: current branch at call time)
- `-f, --from REF` — git ref to fork the new worktree's branch from (default: `HEAD`)
- `--no-launch` — open the worktree tab but do NOT start kiro

If local `<base>` is strictly behind `origin/<base>`, `task-work` auto-refreshes and forks the new worktree from `origin/<base>` instead of the stale local tip. Pass `--from` to override.

Examples:
```bash
task-work add-auth "https://github.com/{OWNER}/{REPO}/issues/42"
task-work https://github.com/{OWNER}/{REPO}/issues/42
task-work refactor-auth -m claude-opus-4.6 --trust-all
task-work issue-99 --from task/issue-46 --base main         # stack on an in-flight branch
task-work spike-idea --no-launch
```

`task-done [options]` — from within a worktree: show diff, print/detect PR, cleanup

- `--force` — skip all confirmation prompts
- `--remove-worktree` — cleanup only (use after worker has already created the PR)
### PM ↔ worker messaging (radio)

Radio is the **canonical** coordination channel between the PM and workers — every
role transition runs through it. The PM / planner / worker agents shell out to
`radio send` at every documented handoff point:

| From     | When                              | Command                                                                          |
|----------|-----------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Planner  | spec written into the issue       | `radio send --to pm --intent spec-ready --issue <N>`                             |
| Worker   | PR opened                         | `radio send --to pm --intent review-requested --pr <N>`                          |
| Worker   | new commits pushed after review   | `radio send --to pm --intent re-review-requested --pr <N>`                       |
| PM       | review requested changes          | `radio send --to <worker-role> --intent changes-requested --pr <N>`              |
| PM       | PR merged                         | `radio send --to <worker-role> --intent approved-and-merged --pr <N>`            |
| Reviewer | review done, no findings          | `radio send --to pm --intent review-complete-clean --pr <N>`                     |
| Reviewer | review done, blockers/nits posted | `radio send --to pm --intent review-complete-with-findings --pr <N>`             |

When a worker finishes its task and has nothing pending, the `radio ready` step
runs automatically via the `agentStop` hook — you don't need to invoke it
manually.

**Delivery here is best-effort — kiro agents pull, they don't receive.** The
hooks under `.kiro/hooks/` keep each role's session file accurate, but kiro
does not inject hook output into the agent's context, so nothing a hook prints
ever reaches the model: `agentSpawn`'s offline-backlog summary is discarded,
`userPromptSubmit` is a plain `radio busy` with no inbox summary, and
`agentStop`'s `radio check` writes to the hook subshell rather than the agent.
There is also no kiro equivalent of the Stop-hook block that makes a busy agent
drain its queue before going idle. That leaves the zellij keystroke wake — one
best-effort push with no fallback behind it.

So the agents poll instead: every agent in `.kiro/agents/` carries a standing
instruction to run `radio check` at the start of each turn and `radio read <id>`
whatever it lists. If you are waiting on a handoff that seems not to have
arrived, prompt the recipient tab — its next turn starts with a check.

There is likewise no session-end trigger (`agentStop` fires per turn, not on
session close), so closing a tab leaves its session file behind still
advertising `STATE=idle`, and senders will keep trying to wake a tab that is
gone. `task-done` unregisters on the worker happy path; for everything else,
`radio orphans` is the cleanup step — see below.

Full command form:

```bash
radio send --to <role> --intent <kind> [--pr N] [--issue N] [--body TEXT]
```

The body comes from `--body` or stdin. PR review *content* still lives in
`gh pr comment`s — `radio` only carries the routing ping. Worker role names
follow `worker-<reponame>-<slug>`; discover the live one via
`ls ~/.task-force/radio/sessions/`.

To launch the PM agent in this repo, run `task-pm` from any tab — it renames
the current zellij tab to `pm`, registers via the `agentSpawn` hook, and
starts the PM agent in-place.

To dispatch a one-shot reviewer worker for a PR, run
`task-reviewer <pr-url-or-number> [<issue-url-or-number>]` from any spare tab.
It spawns a fresh zellij tab + worktree on the PR's head ref, runs the kiro
`reviewer` agent, cross-checks the PR against the spec issue (passed as the
second arg, or auto-detected from the PR body's first `Closes #N` /
`Fixes #N` / `Resolves #N` line, case-insensitive), reviews the diff, posts a single thorough PR comment via
`gh pr comment`, and radios PM back with `review-complete-clean` or
`review-complete-with-findings`. PM still owns the merge decision — the
reviewer never approves, merges, or mutates status. The reviewer tab stays
open showing the analysis; clean up with `task-done --remove-worktree` when
done.

If a worker tab dies unexpectedly, is closed without `task-done`, or kiro
resumes a session without re-firing the `agentSpawn` hook, the session file's
`LAST_HEARTBEAT` will go stale. Run `radio orphans` to list any session whose
heartbeat is older than 1 hour — those entries are safe to delete
(`rm ~/.task-force/radio/sessions/<role>.info`) or leave for the next
legitimate `radio register` to overwrite. Because there is no session-end hook
here, treat this as routine housekeeping rather than a crash-only step: a stale
session still reads as `STATE=idle` to senders, so radio will keep aiming wakes
at a tab that no longer exists.

`radio unregister` on its own is **not** a cleanup command (#198). With no
`SessionEnd` payload naming a real exit on stdin it refuses and says so on
stderr, whatever shape that stdin has — a terminal used to bypass the guard
and wipe the session silently. Pass `--manual` when you mean to tear the
session down; that is what `task-done` does, and it still works from any
stdin shape.

The session file is a soft cache, not the source of truth (#188). Two tiny
sidecars sit beside it — `<role>.loadout` and `<role>.agent` — holding the
values a re-seed cannot read out of the `.info` file it is replacing, and they
deliberately **survive `unregister`**, `task-done`'s `--manual` one included.
Only a genuine `register` overwrites them, and `radio gc` reclaims them once
the role has no session file left at all. So when a wipe is followed by a
`busy` / `ready` self-heal, the rebuilt session keeps the real `LOADOUT` /
`AGENT` instead of `unknown` / `claude`, and it recovers `TAB_ID` from the
task-work-owned `<worktree-base>/.<slug>.info` when the zellij name lookup
misses. An empty `TAB_ID` — the state that makes a role permanently unwakeable,
since `radio send` then queues with no wake attempt — is now written only when
there is genuinely no binding anywhere (non-zellij / CI paths), and the log
says so distinctly.

### When radio misbehaves

Every radio failure found so far has been a **notification** failure, not a
lost message: a session file wiped out from under a live role, a wake that
typed text nobody submitted, a stop-hook that let an unread message sit. The
mail itself is never deleted — it waits in
`~/.task-force/radio/mailbox/<role>/inbox/` until someone reads it. So when
radio looks broken, start at the log (`~/.task-force/radio/log`), not at the
mailbox.

| Symptom | Cause and check |
|---------|-----------------|
| Pinged a role, nothing happened | Re-read the sender's own outcome line — only `delivered` means a keystroke landed; every other line names its own reason. Then `ls ~/.task-force/radio/sessions/` (is the role there, spelled exactly?) and `radio orphans` (a >1h-stale heartbeat means the tab is gone). In the recipient's own tab, `radio check` tells you whether the message arrived and simply wasn't acted on. |
| `radio check` sitting unsubmitted in a prompt box | The wake was delivered but not submitted: that role's session file has no `AUTO_SUBMIT=1`, so the wake ended with LF instead of CR (#189). Press Enter to finish this one. `task-pm` sets the flag for the PM (`--no-auto-submit` opts out), but a kiro **worker** never gets it — `task-work` here has no `--auto` flag, so worker wakes always end in LF and always need the keypress. That is consistent with the poll model below: the agent's own `radio check` is what drains the message, not the keystroke. |
| A role keeps vanishing from `sessions/` | Session flapping — something fires a session-end wipe on an intra-session event and takes `TAB_ID` with it. Compare `grep -c 'unregister role='`, `'unregister: proceeding'` and `'unregister: skipping'` in the log: post-#187 `skipping` should carry the bulk of the traffic, and `role=` should be close to `proceeding` plus however many `--manual` calls `task-done` made. `role=` far above both means an **old `radio` binary** is running — every non-`--manual` call logs one or the other now. `radio` on `PATH` is a symlink into a checkout; run `ls -l "$(command -v radio)"` and confirm that tree is current. |
| `radio unregister` did nothing | Expected since #198, not a bug. With no payload naming a real exit it refuses, printing `refusing to wipe <role> … re-run with --manual` on stderr and logging a `skipping` line. Pass `--manual` if you meant to tear the session down. |
| A role idles on a message sitting in its own inbox | Fixed in #197. `BLOCKED_IDS=` in the session file records which ids the last stop-hook block was about, so a message arriving mid-drain earns its own continuation. In the log, `arrived during the drain turn` is a correct re-block; `no new message since the block` is the loop-breaker firing because the same ids were ignored twice. |

The log is the only place several of these states are distinguishable at all.
It is shared by every repo and role on the machine, so read timestamps rather
than raw counts — and a field missing from an old line means an older binary
wrote it, not that the value was unset:

```bash
L=~/.task-force/radio/log
grep -c 'send id=' "$L"; grep -c 'send: woke' "$L"   # sent vs. actually woken
grep -oE 'is busy|is awaiting|looks dead|no session for|has no TAB_ID|tab id unresolved|no writable pane|write-chars failed' "$L" | sort | uniq -c | sort -rn
grep -oE 'skipping \(empty payload on [a-z-]+ stdin' "$L" | sort | uniq -c
grep -oE 'tab_id_src=[a-z-]+' "$L" | sort | uniq -c   # `none` = role is unwakeable
grep -c 'no tab binding for' "$L"; grep -c 'loadout=unknown' "$L"
```

Undelivered mail is never dropped. The message is written to the inbox
**before** any wake is attempted, so every outcome other than `delivered`
means "on disk, waiting" rather than "gone". `radio gc` never touches
`inbox/` (only `processed/`), and it refuses to reclaim a role's mailbox at
all while that inbox still holds unread mail. There is no dead-letter queue —
an undeliverable message just waits, and `radio gc --dry-run` shows what a
sweep would remove without removing it.

When the wake itself fails there is nothing behind it. Kiro discards hook
output, so none of those backstops exist here — the zellij keystroke is the
only push path, and what actually makes delivery happen is each agent's own
standing `radio check` at the top of every turn. A queued message with no wake
is expected on kiro rather than a failure; it surfaces on the recipient's next
turn. Tell a kiro role apart by its `AGENT=` line
(`grep AGENT ~/.task-force/radio/sessions/<role>.info`).
